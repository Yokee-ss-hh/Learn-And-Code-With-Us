Basic Syntax 
Variables, Comments, Casting (Implicit and Explicit),snake case, Camel case , pascal case, user input etc....
In Built Data Types (Numeric, Sequence, Text, Mapping, Set, Boolean, Binary, None. (TIP : Refer files in the Repository)) and Walrus Operator
Mutable and Immutable differences and main concepts regarding memory usage
Iterable Expressions (List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary Comprehensions)
In Built Functions like (map, filter, max, min, sum...........etc, Explore more by searching google or refer Inbuilt functions.py in the Repository)
Conditional Statements (if,elif,else,match-case)
Looping Statements (for,while)
Iterators
Generators, Generator Expressions, Lazy Evaluation vs Strict Evaluation , Normal methods vs generators, generator methods like send(),yield from and raise()  etc....
Scope of variables and Functions
Anonymous Functions (Lambda)
Closures, Decorators, Decorator Chaining, Decorators with parameters and without parameters
Dunder or Magic methods
Descriptors 
File Handling
Exceptions Handling
Modules and packages 
Main Important Modules (os,sys,itertools,functools,math,collections,regex,abc,random,datetime,requests,json etc...)
OOPS
{
  1) classes
  2) objects
  3) constructors, destructors and it's methods , constructor inheritance using Base() and Super()
  4) methods vs functions difference
  5) types of methods : static vs class vs instance 
  6) types of variables : static variables / class variables and instance variables / object variables
  7) Inheritance(single,multiple,multi-level,hierarchial,hybrid)
     {
      - In multiple inheritance,constructor inheritance using class name creates duplicates
      - How the above problem is solved using super()
      - How mro works 
      - How super() uses mro internally
      - How super() resolves duplicates from 2 parents in hybrid inheritance
     }
  8) Abstraction using abc module
  9) polymorphism , function overloading and method overriding 
  10) Interfaces using abstract base classes in which all methods are of abstract type
  11) Encapsulation using Underscores anology
  12) data hiding and reflection
  13) Data Classes (inbuilt init, repr, field(), inheritance anologies.....etc)
  14) Dunder / Magic methods (very important)
  15) InnerClasses (single inner class, multiple inner classes inside a single class, multilevel inner classes ...)
}
Typing and Types Modules (These 2 modules gives static typing effects)
Collections Module
Data Structures and Algorithms
{
  1) Linked Lists (singly linked list, double linked list, circular linked list, circular doubly linked lists)
  2) Stack 
  3) Queue ( Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, Doubly Ended Queue(deque)) 
  4) Tree ( InOrder,PreOrder and PostOrder Traversals) , (General Tree with 'n' branches, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, N-ary Tree)
  5) Graph ( BFS and DFS)
  6) Heap (min-heap and max-heap)
  7) Algorithms
  {
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Memoization technique
   - Recursion
   - Branch and Bound using BFS
   - Back Traking using DFS
   - Inorder, Preorder and Postorder in trees
  }
}
