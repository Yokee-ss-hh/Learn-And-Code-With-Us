'''
unsafe_hash: If False (the default), a __hash__() method is generated according to how eq and frozen are set.
__hash__() is used by built-in hash(), and when objects are added to hashed collections 
such as dictionaries and sets. 
Having a __hash__() implies that instances of the class are immutable.
Mutability is a complicated property that depends on the programmerâ€™s intent, the existence
and behavior of __eq__(), and the values of the eq and frozen flags in the dataclass() decorator.
By default, dataclass() will not implicitly add a __hash__() method unless it is safe to do so.
Neither will it add or change an existing explicitly defined __hash__() method.
Setting the class attribute __hash__ = None has a specific meaning to Python, 
as described in the __hash__() documentation.
If __hash__() is not explicitly defined, or if it is set to None,
then dataclass() may add an implicit __hash__() method.
Although not recommended, you can force dataclass() to create a __hash__() method with unsafe_hash=True. 
This might be the case if your class is logically immutable but can nonetheless be mutated. 
This is a specialized use case and should be considered carefully.
Here are the rules governing implicit creation of a __hash__() method.
Note that you cannot both have an explicit __hash__() method in your dataclass and set unsafe_hash=True; 
this will result in a TypeError.
If eq and frozen are both true, by default dataclass() will generate a __hash__() method for you. 
If eq is true and frozen is false, __hash__() will be set to None, marking it 
unhashable (which it is, since it is mutable). 
If eq is false, __hash__() will be left untouched meaning the __hash__() method of the superclass 
will be used (if the superclass is object, this means it will fall back to id-based hashing).
